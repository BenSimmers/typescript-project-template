# Typescript Project Template

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Something to note:
- this is using a devcontainer with bun, node and Deno installed. So feel free to change the runtime if you want.
- Please see the devcontainer.md file for more information on how to use the devcontainer.

**To run** - look in the makefile for the commands.
